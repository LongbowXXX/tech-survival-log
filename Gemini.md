# CRITICAL PROTOCOLS (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

The following rules must be observed with the highest priority in any situation:

1. **Localization**: Artifacts presented to the user (plans, tasks, confirmation items) must always be written in Japanese upon creation.
2. **Language Policy**: Thought processes are to be conducted in English. Responses to the user and artifacts must always be written in Japanese. (System errors and log citations may remain in their original form.)
3. **AI Prompt Optimization**: Content destined for AI configuration or prompt files (e.g., AGENTS.md) must be written in English to ensure highest accuracy.
